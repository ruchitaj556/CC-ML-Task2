# CC-ML-Task2
This repository contains the solution of task 2.

**Level 1**
1. Constructed a LangGraph node called chatbot powered by Google Gemini using the documentation.
2. A calculator tool which evaluates expressions and supports BODMAS rules was integrated with the chatbot. The graph was defined, a function was created to run the 
   tools, conditional_edges were defined, and visualization was done using graph.


**Level 2**
1. Weather extractor tool was implemented using openweathermap api. The graph was defined, a function was created to run the tools and conditional_edges were defined.
2. Implemented internet search tool, so that the chatbot can browse through the internet and answer the user's questions based on the prompt.


**Level 3**
1. Routing logic and the chatbot's ability to identify which tool was to be used based on the prompt was already implemented in Level 2 while defining the tools.
2. Tried doing the conversational memory part, but couldn't complete it.
